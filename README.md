# Portfolio
Projects I have made in computational sciences. Examples : 

1. Bike Share Bike Relocation Optimization Software Demo (Machine Learning demand forecasting, relocation heuristic and local search metaheuristic for routing) (React, Mapbox, Bing Map API and C++ back-end, Python for forecasting and data processing):

Night operations 7 truck solution for Montreal's bike share data (12-07-2019 from test data set). Green stations are emptied and red stations are filled.

(In the morning, bikes are leaving residential-like areas in direction of Downtown Montreal and in
the late afternoon this trend is reversed. This represents a typical commute to work weekday.)

2. Stock Cutting Optimization Software for Rebar Shop (With Stock Management): integer programming and software development (JavaFX, Java and Python).
