# Portfolio
Side projects I have made in computational sciences. Examples : 

1. Bike Share Bike Relocation Optimization Software (Machine Learning demand forecasting, dynamic programming, relocation heuristic and search heuristic for routing): this is a real-time automated system responsible for dispatching tasks for the operations fleet of the Montreal Bike Share (battery swap and bike relocation tasks). Since the deployment, it has dispatched more than 200 000 tasks.

(In the morning, bikes are leaving residential-like areas in direction of Downtown Montreal and in
the late afternoon this trend is reversed. This represents a typical commute to work weekday.)

2. Stock Cutting Optimization Software for Rebar Shop (With Stock Management): integer programming and software development (JavaFX, Java and Python).

3. Tabu Search : travelling salesman problem solution by 2-opt probabilistic tabu search.

4. CUDA programming (GPGPU) : Fast boundary problems numerical solver by finite difference using CUDA parallel programming (Massive speed-up compared to cpu benchmarks, >100x).
